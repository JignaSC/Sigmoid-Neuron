# Sigmoid-Neuron
The building block of the deep neural networks is called the sigmoid neuron.\
Just like a perceptron, the sigmoid neuron has inputs, x1,x2,…. But instead of being just 0 or 1, these inputs can also take on any values between 0 and 1.\

The inputs to the sigmoid neuron can be real numbers unlike the boolean inputs.\
In the sigmoid neuron, we are trying to regress the relationship between X and Y in terms of probability. Even though the output is between 0–1, we can still use the sigmoid function for binary classification tasks by choosing some threshold.\
